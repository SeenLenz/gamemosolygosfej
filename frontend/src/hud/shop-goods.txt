active healt items -> potions: small, big
passive health items
    -> food of sorts: bread, cheese, fish?
    -> (cheaper, heals less, gives minor damage reduction for limited duration if you eat enough couse you r fat?)

potions
    ->(game is steampunk so I'll just call them tonics couse british people, all for limited duration)
    -> speed boost (letargy after looses effect), slight + damage?, jump boost, extra dash distance

fire bottle?
    -> throwable aoe fire stuff it burns, if nothing else it should give to the scene

upgrades?
    -> like electric shot for the pistol (more efficiente against automatons, chain lightning effect on groupes of enemies in close proximity of eachother)
    -> reload speed reduction (should encourage use of the pistol making upgrades more desirable)
    -> should give extra reason to kill the shopkeep
